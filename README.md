## 🚀 Getting Started (Pi-local, lightweight)

### One command run (recommended)

```bash
cd /home/jesse/clawd-steve/fantasy-baseball
./run-local.sh
```

This will:
- create/use `.venv`
- install backend deps from `backend/requirements.txt`
- start API on `127.0.0.1:8000`
- healthcheck `/api/health`
- start frontend on `127.0.0.1:4173`

Open:
- Frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
- API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

Stop:
```bash
./stop-local.sh
```

### Canonical database path

By default, all services use:
`/home/jesse/clawd-steve/data/fantasy_baseball.db`

Override if needed:
```bash
FANTASY_DB_PATH=/path/to/other.db ./run-local.sh
```

## 🎯 Project Vision & Roadmap

### What This Tool Is (Not Just a Dashboard)

#### 1. Roster Optimization & Strategy Analysis
- Analyze team construction vs. league averages
- Suggest optimal lineup configurations based on matchups (vs. LHP/RHP, park factors)
- Identify category weaknesses
- Salary cap modeling for auction leagues

#### 2. Sentiment & Hype Tracking
- Track social media buzz (Twitter/X, Reddit, fantasy forums)
- Monitor ADP movement (offseason vs. pre-draft)
- Identify sleepers and busts
- Detect buy low / sell high signals

#### 3. Target Identification
- ADP targets (players to draft before value rises)
- Waiver wire gems (free agents before others notice)
- Trade targets (undervalued players)
- Pop-up prospects (minor league standouts)

#### 4. Draft Strategy
- Snake draft optimization
- Auction league bid modeling
- Points vs. Roto league adjustments
- Positional scarcity analysis

#### 5. Prospect Focus (Secret Weapon)
- Deep prospects (top 400 + sleepers)
